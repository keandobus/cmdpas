CMDPAS - CMD Password Authentication System
Created by keandobus

A way to use a command interpreter to authenticate users in a semi-secure way using tools built into Windows. Tested on Windows 10 mostly.

I have not figured out how to obfuscate the password entry as of now. I have researched a couple of ways but have not tried any advanced techniques.
